FINAL PROJECT SUBMISSION: README FOR TRAIL DATABASE UI


DESIGN DETAILS

UI Program Language: Java
DBMS: mySQL
Operating Systems Tested On: macOS (ARM), Windows


SETUP INSTRUCTIONS

1) Run the SQL file in mySQL to create the database schema and records
2) Open the Java file in your preferred IDE (we used IntelliJ)
3) At the top of the Main class, look for the following line where the instance for the database connection
   is created:

   connection = DriverManager.getConnection("jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/project10_db", "root", "1231");

4) Ensure the port number, "localhost:3306", matches your local mySQL connection
5) Change the password from "1231" to your mySQL root password
6) Run the program. A small window should popup called "Trail Database".
